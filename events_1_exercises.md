# Events Exercises

_Create a separate HTML, JS, and (if necessary) CSS file for each of these exercises._

## Exercise 1: Loaded!

Fill your HTML file with some [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) text in `p` tags. Import your JS file in a `script` tag in the `head` of your HTML page. _After the page loads,_ you should send an alert to the window telling users that the page has loaded.

## Exercise 2: Jack is Back!

Copy your Jack in the Box code from the DOM 2 exercise. Instead of starting your timers when the page loads, add a button with the text "Wind Up Jack!". When the user presses this button, your timers should start.

## Exercise 3: Feed the Form!

Using the `form` tag and event listeners, create a BuzzFeed-style quiz (e.g. "What Hogwarts house are you?" or "What do your ice cream habits say about your political views?", etc). Use your own prompts for questions and your own logic to determine quiz results. When your user submits their quiz, you should display their results underneath the form.

Hints to help you with quiz logic:

- Use numerical values. For example, if you're going with "What do your ice cream habits say about your political views", if the user picks "Pistachio", you may give them +1 to a `progressive` variable. If they choose "Rocky Road", you might give them +1 to `conservative`.
- Don't be afraid to fudge numbers. For example, in the "Hogwarts House" quiz, if the user picks an equal number of answers to be placed in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, you might just pick one at random.
- Similarly, if you'd like, you're welcome to give them more explicit answers. If they're 50 percent Hufflepuff and 50 percent Ravenclaw, they might want to know!
